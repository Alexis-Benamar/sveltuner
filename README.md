# sveltuner

> _just a bit more... just a bit less..._

A simple bass / guitar tuner made with SvelteKit. It doesnt actually listen for sounds but plays back the correct note when the corresponding string is pressed.

## Testing locally

You first need to install dependencies
```sh
pnpm install
```

Then you can run the dev server
```sh
# run dev server
pnpm run dev

# same but directly open the app in a browser tab
pnpm run dev --open
```
